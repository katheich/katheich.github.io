        A keen learner with a background in economic consulting, my interest in problem-solving perhaps inevitably led me to software engineering. Thriving in a collaborative environment and bringing with me an incessant need to understand “why”, I am looking to start my career in this field as part of a team where I can learn every day from more experienced colleagues.        
        
        <br/><br/>
        Holding a BA in Economics and Philosophy from the <a className="has-text-weight-semibold" href="https://www.york.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/ba-economics-philosophy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of York</a> and an MSc in Economic and Social Sciences from <a className="has-text-weight-semibold" href="https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/Bocconi/SitoPubblico_EN/Navigation+Tree/Home/Programs/Master+of+Science/Economic+and+Social+Sciences/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bocconi University</a> in Milan, my education provides a solid background in analytical thinking. After finishing my studies, I worked for three years as a competition economist at <a className="has-text-weight-semibold" href="http://www.rbbecon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RBB Economics</a>, where I also learned a lot; from hard skills such as expert report drafting and economic analyses to softer skills such as client-facing communication and working in a team.     
        <br/><br/>
        Recognising my desire to understand the "why" behind processes and a talent for logical thinking, I decided to dive into the field of software engineering. I enrolled in the Software Engineering Immersive course at <a className="has-text-weight-semibold" href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/software-engineering-immersive/london" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">General Assembly</a> to not only gain the technical skills of coding, but to also understand the broader context of these tools. It was also great to spend twelve weeks in such a supportive environment, where everyone is going through the same experience of starting a new skill coming from a different background, and I look forward to continuing this learning journey in my next position.
