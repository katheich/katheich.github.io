      <div className="text is-size-6">
        A keen learner with a background in economic consulting, my interest in problem-solving perhaps inevitably led me to software engineering. Thriving in a collaborative environment and bringing with me an incessant need to understand “why”, I am looking to start my career in this field as part of a team where I can learn every day from more experienced colleagues.        
        
        <br/><br/>
        Holding a BA in Economics and Philosophy from the <span className="has-text-weight-semibold	">University of York</span> and an MSc in Economic and Social Sciences from <span className="has-text-weight-semibold	">Bocconi University</span> in Milan, my education provides a solid background in analytical thinking. After finishing my studies, I worked for three years as a competition economist at <span className="has-text-weight-semibold	">RBB Economics</span>, where I also learned a lot; from hard skills such as expert report drafting and economic analyses to softer skills such as client-facing communication and working in a team.     
        <br/><br/>
        Recognising my desire to understand the "why" behind processes and a talent for logical thinking, I decided to dive into the field of software engineering. I enrolled in the Software Engineering Immersive course at <span className="has-text-weight-semibold	">General Assembly</span> to not only gain the technical skills of coding, but to also understand the broader context of these tools. It was also great to spend twelve weeks in such a supportive environment, where everyone is going through the same experience of starting a new skill coming from a different background, and I look forward to continuing this learning journey in my next position.
